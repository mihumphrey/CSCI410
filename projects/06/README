HOW TO RUN:

My program can be compiled by simply running 'make', then ran with the executable 'assembler'
    To run it in normal mode, simply type ./assembler <ASM FILE>, e.g. ./assembler pong/Pong.asm
    To run it in verbose mode, simply add '-v' to the end, e.g. ./assembler pong/Pong.asm -v
        This gives extra output as to how my program is working
    To run all of the files given, simply type 'make grade'
        **NOTE** This runs my assembler against the nand2tetris given assembler, then diff's the results, and ensures that they are the same
