 HOW TO RUN:
 
 My program can be compiled by simply running 'make', then ran with the executable 'translator'
     To run it in normal mode, simply type ./translator <VM FILE>, e.g. ./translator StackArithmetic/StackTest/StackTest.vm
     To run it in verbose mode, simply add '-v' to the end, e.g. ./translator StackArithmetic/StackTest/StackTest.vm -v
         This gives extra output as to how my program is working
     To run all of the files given, simply type 'make grade'
         **NOTE** This runs my translator on all given files, then runs the CPUEmulator on the .tst files and ensures that they pass.
