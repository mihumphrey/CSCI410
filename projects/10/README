- I found that it was interesting how a recursive algorithm can be implemented with little to no recursion

 HOW TO RUN:
 
 My program can be compiled by simply running 'make', then ran with the executable 'compiler'
     To run it in normal mode, simply type ./compiler <Source Directory>, e.g. ./compiler Square/
     To run it in verbose mode, simply add '-v' to the end, e.g. ./compiler Square -v
         This gives extra output as to how my program is working
     To run all of the files given, simply type 'make grade'
         **NOTE** This runs my compiler on all given files, then runs the TextComparator on the given .xml files and ensures that they pass.
