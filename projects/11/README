- I did not receive help on this assignment

- This project took well over 15 hours to complete

- My 'aha' moment was when I realized that I need to store methods as arg 0

- My compiler is buit with a makefile, simply by running 'make'
    The directory may be specified as a command line argument with the optional -v flag for verbose output
    The make command creates an executable 'compiler' in the cwd.
    Simply run ./compiler [filename] [-v]? to execute my code
